# Twitter-Data-Collector
Data Collector in python for twitter
<br><br>
This is a data collector I built in python using the flask framework and the twitter api which you can get from their dev portal to get the bearer token. If you are curious in seeing it you can go down to the live demo. This PROJECT IS STILL in development im trying to format the result for the tweets.
